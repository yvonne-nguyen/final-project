				<h2>Martin Heidegger</h2>
				<p>Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher who is best known for his contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism. He is often considered to be among the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century.</p>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">das Man</button>
				<div class="content">
                <p>One of the central concepts In Being and Time is Martin Heidegger’s treatment of authenticity. Heidegger asserts the default mode for human beings is to live what he describes as inauthentic. For example, rather than facing up to one’s own finitude—represented above all by the inevitability of death—human beings seek distraction and escape into moods such as curiosity, ambiguity, and idle talk. Heidegger characterized such conformity in terms of the notion of the anonymous das Man (“the They” or "the One").

                <p>Heidegger refers to this concept of the One in explaining inauthentic modes of existence, in which Dasein, instead of truly choosing to do something, does it only because "That is what one does" or "That is what people do". Thus, das Man is not a proper or measurable entity, but rather an amorphous part of social reality that functions effectively in the manner that it does through this intangibility.</p>

                <p>Das Man constitutes a possibility of Dasein's Being, and so das Man cannot be said to be any particular someone. Rather, the existence of 'the They' is known to us through, for example, linguistic conventions and social norms. Heidegger states that, "The "they" prescribes one's state-of-mind, and determines what and how one 'sees'".</p>

                <p>To give examples: when one makes an appeal to what is commonly known, one says "one does not do such a thing"; When one sits in a car or bus or reads a newspaper, one is participating in the world of 'the They'. This is a feature of 'the They' as it functions in society, an authority that has no particular source. In a non-moral sense Heidegger contrasts "the authentic self" ("my owned self") with "the they self" ("my un-owned self").</p>
